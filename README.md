Short story: I believe in the ability of data to create stories and transform the reality around us.

Long story: Business administrator with a focus on project management and current Data Science student in Protalent. 
I enjoy working on projects that involve data, stories, and code to solve complex problems.
I believe in the potential of data to generate value propositions, invent new services or products and especially help create sustainable companies over time.

¡Get in touch if you have an interesting project I can collaborate on or if you just want to chat about common interests!
😊 let´s create new stories together.
